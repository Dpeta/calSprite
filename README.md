# calSprite
calSprite redux
A simple bot for irc servers meant to be used with Pesterchum to serve similar functionality as the original calSprite bot using python3's socket module.
Credit to the original author of the bot, though I'm not entirely certain as to who that is. (Hydrothermal?)

Configure the variables at the top of "client.py" and execute it, or run "run.py" if you'd like to have it automatically restart in the case of unexpected crashes.

Currently only does:
  - report
  - onlineall

### Software requirements

 - Python 3 (Ideally, 3.6 or higher.)

 - OpenSSL



### Required Python modules

 - os

 - sys

 - time

 - socket

 - random

 - ssl



### Disclaimer

This bot *may* be exceptionally shoddy.
